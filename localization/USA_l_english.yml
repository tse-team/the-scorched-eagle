DONALD_J_TRUMP_DESC: "Donald Trump has been described as many things. A populist, protectionist, isolationist, nationalist, patriot, and first and foremost, president. After his first term in office and his unfulfillment of campaign promises, many traditionally conservative Americans felt like they had been betrayed, but still clung on tightly to the idea of “Making America Great Again”,leading Donald Trump to make a surprising victory in the 2020 election, and the preservation of the Greater American status quo.\nOverseeing political instability and mass unrest sparked by no more than himself, the national atmosphere is no more than melancholy. As America’s sphere of influence barely encapsulates itself, there are growing fears of the country descending into complete anarchy. Each year, the government becomes less and less functioning; at least as a democratic one."
